What is the openvpn-frontend role for? Why isn't it part of the 'openvpn' role?

The "openvpn-frontend" group is completely unrelated to float at all, its there
to solve an ansible problem: modules/roles can't export "facts" for other roles
to consume. So, how do you customize a role with data that belongs to something
else?

In our situation, we want to customize DNS with openvpn-specific data. The
"openvpn" group, where the "openvpn" role runs, might not overlap with the hosts
where dns-servers are running. So we create a new role, and tell ansible to run
it on *top* of the *other* one. The "openvpn-frontend" thus has 'hosts:
frontend', which is the ansible group corresponding to the role that runs dns
servers. If ansible had a way to allow a group to indicate "we have this DNS
information, dns-role please consume it", then this would not be necessary.

The problematic bit is that we want to schedule the openvpn-frontend role on the
'frontend' groups, and there is no openvpn-frontend service, so instead we are
customizing the 'frontend' role

If you did not define any groups in hosts.yml, float would still work, it would
turn up nginx somewhere, backends somewhere else, and all work. But it turns
out, when deploying to the real-world, people do care where their frontends run,
as this is your public footprint.  So float comes with the assumption that there
will be a "frontend" group in your invetory, and just relies on the fact that
the "frontend" role is scheduled there with num_instances=all
