Roles:

openvpn: this role conains the firewall modifications for openvpn (the firewall
should go with the services, because the port, eg. 1194, "belongs" to the
openvpn service, regardless of where it is scheduled), along with the general
openvpn configuration information

openvpn-frontend: this role will be scheduled on http/dns servers, so this role
contains the dns modifications
