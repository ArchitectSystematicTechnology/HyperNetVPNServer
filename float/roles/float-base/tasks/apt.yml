# Set the global apt HTTP proxy to the value of 'apt_proxy'. This
# will cover the default package sources (so we don't have to mangle
# sources.list). For https sources though we're going to have to use
# the awful {% if %} construct inline, to inject the apt_proxy in
# the apt_repository itself. See the docker role for an example.
