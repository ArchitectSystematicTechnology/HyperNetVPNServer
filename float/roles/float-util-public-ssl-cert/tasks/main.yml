# This role simply creates a self-signed SSL certificate for initial
# service startup (which happens before the ACME automation has a
# chance to run) in /etc/credentials/public.
#
# The 'cn' parameter must be defined by the calling role.
#
# The naming scheme for the credentials follows somewhat a common
# ACME convention: the full chain of public certificates (including
# the Letsencrypt roots) is stored in 'fullchain.pem', the private
# key in 'privkey.pem'.
